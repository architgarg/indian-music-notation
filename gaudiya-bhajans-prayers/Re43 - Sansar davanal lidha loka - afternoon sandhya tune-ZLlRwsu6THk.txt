WORD FOR WORD TRANSLATION: Samsara Davanala Lidha Loka

TRANSLATION

1) The spiritual master is receiving benediction from the ocean of mercy. Just
as a cloud pours water on a forest fire to extinguish it, so the spiritual
master delivers the materially afflicted world by extinguishing the blazing fire
of material existence. I offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of
such a spiritual master, who is an ocean of auspicious qualities.

2) Chanting the holy name, dancing in ecstasy, singing, and playing musical
instruments, the spiritual master is always gladdened by the sankirtana movement
of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Because he is relishing the mellows of pure
devotion within his mind, sometimes his hair stands on end, he feels quivering
in his body, and tears flow from his eyes like waves. I offer my respectful
obeisances unto the lotus feet of such a spiritual master.

3) The spiritual master is always engaged in the temple worship of Sri Sri Radha
and Krsna. He also engages his disciples in such worship. They dress the Deities
in beautiful clothes and ornaments, clean Their temple, and perform other
similar worship of the Lord. I offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus
feet of such a spiritual master.

4) The spiritual master is always offering Krsna four kinds of delicious food
[analyzed as that which is licked, chewed, drunk, and sucked]. When the
spiritual master sees that the devotees are satisfied by eating
bhagavat-prasada, he is satisfied. I offer my respectful obeisances unto the
lotus feet of such a spiritual master.

5) The spiritual master is always eager to hear and chant about the unlimited
conjugal pastimes of Radhika and Madhava, and Their qualities, names, and forms.
The spiritual master aspires to relish these at every moment. I offer my
respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of such a spiritual master.

6) The spiritual master is very dear, because he is expert in assisting the
gopis, who at different times make different tasteful arrangements for the
perfection of Radha and Krsna's conjugal loving affairs within the groves of
Vrndavana. I offer my most humble obeisances unto the lotus feet of such a
spiritual master.

7) The spiritual master is to be honored as much as the Supreme Lord, because he
is the most confidential servitor of the Lord. This is acknowledged in all
revealed scriptures and followed by all authorities. Therefore I offer my
respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of such a spiritual master, who is a
bona fide representative of Sri Hari [Krsna].

8) By the mercy of the spiritual master one receives the benediction of Krsna.
Without the grace of the spiritual master, one cannot make any advancement.
Therefore, I should always remember and praise the spiritual master. At least
three times a day I should offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of
my spiritual master.

9) One who, with great care and alteration, loudly recites this beautiful prayer
to the spiritual master during the Brahma-muhurta obtains direct service to
Krsna, the Lord of Vrndavana, at the time of his death.
