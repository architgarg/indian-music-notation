WORD FOR WORD TRANSLATION: Radhe Jaya Jaya Madhava Dayite

TRANSLATION

(Refrain) O Radha! O beloved of Madhava! O You who are worshiped by all the young girls of Gokula! All glories unto You! All glories unto You! 

1) You who dress Yourself in such a way as to increase Lord Damodara's love and attachment for You! O queen of Vrndavana, which is the pleasure grove of Lord Hari!

2) O new moon that has arisen from the ocean of King Vrsabhanu! O friend of Lalita! O You who make Visakha loyal to You due to Your wonderful qualities of friendliness, kindness, and faithfulness to Krsna!

3) O You who are filled with compassion! O You whose divine characteristics are described by the great sages Sanaka and Sanatana! O Radha, please be merciful to me!

REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:

This song is usually rendered in Raga Durga by most devotees. However, the original Stavamala text is requires it rendered in Raga Bhairavi. The Abhay Charan serial sings this correctly.
