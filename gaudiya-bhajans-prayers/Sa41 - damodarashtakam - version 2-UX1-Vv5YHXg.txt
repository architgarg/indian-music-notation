WORD FOR WORD TRANSLATION: Namamisvaram Saccidananda Rupam

TRANSLATION

1) To the Supreme Lord, whose form is the embodiment of eternal existence,
knowledge, and bliss, whose shark-shaped earrings are swinging to and fro,
who is beautifully shining in the divine realm of Gokula, who I (due to the
offense of breaking the pot of yogurt that His mother was churning
into butter and then stealing the butter that was kept hanging from
a swing) is quickly running from the wooden grinding mortar in fear
of mother Yasoda, but who has been caught from behind by her who ran after
Him with greater speed--to that Supreme Lord, Sri Damodara, I offer my
humble obeisances.

2) (Seeing the whipping stick in His mother's hand) He is crying and rubbing
His eyes again and again with His two lotus hands. His eyes are filled with
fear, and the necklace of pearls around His neck, which is marked with three
lines like a conch shell, is shaking because of His quick breathing due to
crying. To this Supreme Lord, Sri Damodara, whose belly is bound not with
ropes but with His mother's pure love, I offer my humble obeisances.

3) By such childhood pastimes as this He is drowning the inhabitants of
Gokula in pools of ecstasy, and is revealing to those devotees who are
absorbed in knowledge of His supreme majesty and opulence that He is only
conquered by devotees whose pure love is imbues with intimacy and is free
from all conceptions of awe and reverence. With great love I again offer my
obeisances to Lord Damodara hundreds and hundreds of times.

4) O Lord, although You are able to give all kinds of benedictions, I do not
pray to You for the boon of impersonal liberation, nor the highest
liberation of eternal life in Vaikuntha, nor any other boon (which may be
obtained by executing the nine processes of bhakti). O Lord, I
simply wish that this form of Yours as Bala Gopala in Vrndavana may ever be
manifest in my heart, for what is the use to me of any other boon besides
this?

5) O Lord, Your lotus face, which is encircled by locks of soft black hair
tinged with red, is kissed again and again by mother Yasoda, and Your lips
are reddish like the bimba fruit. May this beautiful vision of Your lotus
face be ever manifest in my heart. Thousands and thousands of other
benedictions are of no use to me.

6) O Supreme Godhead, I offer my obeisances unto You. O Damodara! O Ananta!
O Vishnu! O master! O my Lord, be pleased upon me. By showering Your glance
of mercy upon me, deliver this poor ignorant fool who is immersed in an
ocean of worldly sorrows, and become visible to my eyes.

7) O Lord Damodara, just as the two sons of Kuvera, Manigriva and
Nalakuvara, were delivered from the curse of Narada and made into great
devotees by You in Your form as a baby tied with rope to a wooden grinding
mortar, in the same way, please give to me Your own prema-bhakti. I only
long for this and have no desire for any kind of liberation.

8) O Lord Damodara, I first of all offer my obeisances to the brilliantly
effulgent rope which binds Your belly. I then offer my obeisances to Your
belly, which is the abode of the entire universe. I humbly bow down to Your
most beloved Srimati Radharani, and I offer all obeisances to You, the
Supreme Lord, who displays unlimited pastimes.

REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:

This song was originally spoken by Satyavrata Muni in a conversation with
Narada Muni and Saunaka Rsi.

This song is sung during the Month of Kartik, also known as the month of
Damodara. As quoted in the Sri Hari-Bhakti-Vilasa, "In the month of Kartika
one should worship Lord Damodara and daily recite the prayer known as
Damodarastaka, which has been spoken by the sage Satyavrata and which
attracts Lord Damodara. (Sri Hari-bhakti-vilasa 2.16.198).”

This is usually sung in Raga Asavari in Lofa or Bengali ektal, or Bhairavi
in kaherva or bhajani tala.
