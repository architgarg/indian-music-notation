WORD FOR WORD TRANSLATION: Gauranga Karuna Koro

TRANSLATION

1) O my dear Lord Gauranga! Please show Your mercy to this lowly and destitute
soul. O Lord! There is no one more fallen than myself in all the three worlds.

2) Holding grass between my teeth, O Lord Gaura, I am calling out to You now!
Please be compassionate upon me and come to reside within the temple of my
heart.

3) If You do not give Your mercy, seeing how fallen I am, then why are You known
as Patita Pavana, the merciful Savior of the fallen?

4) I am plunged amidst the violent hurricane-stricken waves in the ocean of this
material world, from which there is no escape. Kindly give me the gift of Your
divine lotus feet, which are compared to a boat in which Your servant may cross
over the ocean of birth and death.

5) Narottama Dasa, the servant of the servant of Lord Sri Krsna Caitanya Prabhu,
ceaselessly makes this prayer.

Remarks/ Extra Information:

This song is sung in Raga Sindhu Bhairavi in Kaherva Tala.
