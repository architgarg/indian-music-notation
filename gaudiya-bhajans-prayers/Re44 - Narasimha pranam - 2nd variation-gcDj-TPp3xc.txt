WORD-FOR-WORD TRANSLATION: Namaste Narasimhaya

TRANSLATION

1) I offer my obeisances to Lord Narasimha, who gives joy to Prahlada Maharaja
and whose nails are like chisels on the stone like chest of the demon
Hiranyakasipu.

2) Lord Nrsimha is here and also there. Wherever I go Lord Nrsimha is there. He
is in the heart and is outside as well. I surrender to Lord Nrsimha, the origin
of all things and the supreme refuge.

3) O Kesava! O Lord of the universe! O Lord Hari, who have assumed the form of
half-man, half-lionl All glories to You! Just as one can easily crush a wasp
between one's fingernails, so in the same way the body of the wasp like demon
Hiranyakasipu has been ripped apart by the wonderful pointed nails on Your
beautiful lotus hands.
                   
REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:

The third verse of this prayer is the fourth verse of Pralaya Payodhi Jale
(Dasavatara stotram) by Srila Jayadeva Goswami.
 
Mayapura devotees sing the Om Hrim Pram Ksraum (Nrsimha kavaca maha-mantra)
before singing the above verses.

Outside of ISKCON, some devotees will include a verse between 1 and 2 composed
by Sridhara Maharaja.

“vāg-īśā yasya vadane lakṣmīr yasya ca vakṣasi

yasyāste hṛdaye saḿvit taḿ nṛsiḿham ahaḿ bhaje”
 
In His mouth the goddess Suddha-Sarasvati is always present, on His chest
Laksmi-devi always resides, and within His heart special affection for His
devotees is always manifest – I worship that Nrsimhadeva.
