TRANSLATION

1) Oh Lord Gauranga! Please do not neglect to show me Your mercy! Making me Your own very property, kindly keep me situated at the reddish soles of Your feet.

2) With the intention of attaining Your feet, I have utterly renounced everything. Now I have taken full shelter of Your soothing lotus feet.

3) Whether I am related to this family lineage or that family lineage – I have completely abandoned them all. I beg You to mercifully keep me by Your feet, calling me Your own.

4) Vasudeva Ghosa says, “Since I have tightly grasped hold of Your feet, please keep me here by always bestowing their soothing shade.”
