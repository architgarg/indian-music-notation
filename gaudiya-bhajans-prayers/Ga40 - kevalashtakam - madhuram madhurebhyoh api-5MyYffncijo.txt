TRANSLATION

1) More sweet than all other sweet things; more auspicious than all other auspicious things; the greatest purifier of all purifying things. The holy name of Sri Hari alone is everything. [11]

2) The entire universe, from exalted Brahma down to the lowly clump of grass, is a product of the illusory energy of the supreme Lord. The only thing that is reality, reality, again I say reality. The holy name of Sri Hari alone is everything. [39]

3) That person is a true preceptor, or a true father, a true mother, and a true friend also only if they teach one to always remember. The holy name of Sri Hari alone is everything. [50]

4) There is no certainty when the last breath will come and put an abrupt halt to all one’s material plans; therefore, it is wise to always practice chanting from very childhood. The holy name of Sri Hari alone is everything. [57]

5) Lord Hari eternally dwells in that place where truly exalted, spiritually advanced souls sing in the mood of pure devotion. The holy name of Sri Hari alone is everything. [62]

6) Aho! What a sorrow, what a great sorrow! More painful than any other misery in the world! Mistaking it as a mere piece of glass, the people have forgotten this jewel. The holy name of Sri Hari alone is everything. [77]

7) It should be heard again and again with one’s ears; It should be uttered over and over with one’s voice; It should be perpetually sung and sung anew. The holy name of Sri Hari alone is everything. [89]

8) It makes the entire universe seem insignificant as a blade of grass; it reigns supreme over all in a splendorous manner; it is full of eternally conscious divine ecstasy; it is supremely pure. The holy name of Sri Hari alone is everything. [99]
