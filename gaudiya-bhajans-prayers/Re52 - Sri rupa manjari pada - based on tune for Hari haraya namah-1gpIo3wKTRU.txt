WORD FOR WORD TRANSLATION: Sri Rupa Manjari Pada Sei Mora Sampada

TRANSLATION

1) The lotus feet of Sri Rupa Manjari are my treasure, my devotional service,
and my object of worship. They give my life meaning, and they are the life of my
life.

2) They are the perfection of rasa, and they are perfection worthy of
attainment. They are the very law of the Vedlc scriptures for me. They are the
meaning of all my fasts and penances and my silent uttering of my mantras. They
are the basis of religion and activities.

3) By the purifying process of favorable devotional service one will attain
perfection and with these two eyes be able to see. His transcendental form is
shining like moonlight in my heart, and my heart therefore shines and
reciprocates. In other words, the ordinary moon lights up the night, and its
shine illuminates other objects; but the moon of the effulgence of the form of
Sri Rupa Manjari shines into the heart and makes the heart also shine back to
the spiritual sky. This moon shines not only in the nighttime, but day and
night.

4) Your absence from my vision is like a dose of strong poison, and I will
suffer till the end of my life. Narottama dasa Thakura says: "Please give me
your mercy and the shade of your lotus feet."
