Meaning of this beautiful Shloka which has a contrast between ornamented god and god as the supreme ornament:

O Sri Krishna ! The Kasturi (Musk) Tilak, a red ritual mark decorates your forehead and the Kaustubha jewel ornaments your chest

The Nava mouktika, a pearl ornament on your nose, your fingertips graced by a flute, while your wrist is ornamented with a bracelet.

O Sri Hari! Your entire body is bedecked with fragrant sandalwood paste, your neck has a beautiful garland

You gave Mukti (salvation) to the Gopis (lady-cowherds) who followed you, 

Victory be to that Lord who proved to be the choodamani (crest jewel – singular ornament of all ornaments) for even a commoner like a cowherd


“Kasturi Tilakam” is the 2.108 Slokam of Sri Krishna Karnamrutham, a string of Bhakthi laden poems offered at the sacred feet of the Lord . The author of Sri Krishna Karnamrutham is Bilva Mangalar (AD 1220-1300). He was a contemproary of Swami Desikan (AD 1268-1369). Since he described with great joy the leelas of Krishna like Sukha Brahmam, the author of Srimad Bhagavatham, he came to be known as Leela Sukhar. He belongs to the tradition of great devotees of Krishna of Kerala such as Narayana Bhattadhiri, the author of Sri NarayaNeeyam, Poonthaanma and Vasudeva Nambhhodhri and other great scholars of Dasama Skhandham of Srimad Bhagavatham.

 After the humble prayer seeking the Lord'd blessings for constant memory of His
nectar-like Feet, SrI kulaSEkharar surrenders to Him in abject humility and
confesses that there is no other saviour for him except the Lord reclining on
Adi-SEshan ar SrI-rangam. He requests the Lord to protect him. He cries out the
many names of the Lord and begs for protection and concedes that he has no one
to turn to. (mAm pAlaya tvam vinA param na jAnAmi)

When seeking protection, AzhvAr's first thoughts turn to gOpAlan who protected
the cows and calves on the plains of gOkulam. He thinks of that ocean of mercy
(kRpA-jala-nidhi) Who took care of the cows as a cowherd and seeks the same type
of protection from Him.
While thinking of the Ocean of Mercy, AzhvAr's thoughts focus on the daughter of
the Milky Ocean whom the Lord married.  (sindu-kanyA-pati:) 

The AzhvAr's vast knowledge of purANa-s form the basis of his next nAmArcanam-s
like kamsAntaka and gajEndra-karuNA-pAriNa. He reflects on the celebrated
deeds such as the destruction of kamsa and the rescue of the king of elephants
from the mouth of the crocodile at a lotus pond. 
AzhvAr pays his respects to SrI kRshNa avtAram by exclaiming the Lord as
rAmAnuja ( younger Brother of Bala-rAma), as gOpI-jana-nAtha and as the teacher
of the three worlds (jagat-traya-guru) because of His blessings through the
teachings enshrined in the bhagavad-gIta.
