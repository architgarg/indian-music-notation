==================================================

TRANSLATION

1) Such is the attachment in which Mira Bai is drowned in her love for her beloved Lord Krsna. She sings praises of Krsna down each and every street! She was raised in the palaces but now, she is a maidservant and a devotee of Krsna. Some has said that “Queen Mira has gone mad!”

2) Nobody can stop her! Nobody can interrupt her! Mira Bai continues to sing the names of “Govinda! Gopala!” She associates with devotees and get dyed red in love of Krsna. She feels that she and her Lord have finally united!

3) The king fed her poison, but she took it as nectar. She is like a river who has met the ocean. Even though Mira Bai had felt thousands of sufferings and pains, all she knew was chanting of Lord Govinda’s name. All she that was, is, will always be chanting is the names of “Govinda” and “Gopala.”
