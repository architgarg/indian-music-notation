All credit goes to "krishnabhakta" for making these wonderful videos.

How to use the notes:

* An octave of a harmonium contains W1 B1 W2 B2 W3 W4 B3 W5 B4 W6 B5 W7 keys,
which is the sequence of white and black keys. In these notations, Sa is placed
on the first white key of an octave. This is because Prabhuji normally makes the
videos with the hqrmonium scaled to "C#". This can be strange at first as
non-scalable harmoniums are normally set to "C", and the common placement of Sa
is the first black key (B1), normally.

* When multiple notes are pressed at the same, "slash" ("/") separates the
simultaneous notes from each other, e.g. S/P means Sa and Pa pressed at the same
time

* There are three saptaks: Mandra, Madhya and Taar. The notes use "'" single
quote either before or after the actual note indicating its placement, i.e.
whether it is Mandra, Madhya or Taar. E.g. 'S would mean Sa in Mandra saptak, S
would mean Sa in Madhya sapta, and S' would mean Sa in Taar saptak.

* The notes for a line are normally placed above the line that contains the
lyrics for the line.

* The notes are normally put above vowels, however there can be exceptions to
this, e.g. the common one "s(h)" in Krishna's name.

* There can be more than note played for a vowel. However, vowels are not
multiplied in the current notes when a vowel is pronounced a couple of times. It
is up to the reader's understanding about the tune. This may be improved later.

* There can be multiple variations for a part of a tune. These variations are
indicated with v2, v3, etc. Variations normally slightly differ, but the base is
mostly the same. Variations can mean more embellishment, simplification by
leaving a few keys out, changing a couple of keys, or even the same sequence,
but with slightly different distribution over the vowels.

* The tune normally builds up the pace, goes to double time and then at the end,
it comes back to "Part 1", the slow part. Then, it finishes with a closing chord
(normally two notes).

* There can be transient chords (i.e. keys) between subsequent parts. If the
next part does not start where the previous ends, there is normally a way to
smootly change from the previous to the next. This is indicated with "=>" after
each part. E.g. "=> P/S'" would mean that the previous part ends with Pa, and
the next part starts with Taar saptak Sa, so a smooth transition between the two
parts would mean pressing down both Madhya saptak Pa and Taar saptak Sa.

* At some point in the history of this repository, I started becoming more
verbose with the notes for the tunes. This ended up generating more notes
because I started noting down the transition between two notes, e.g. from Sa to
Re. It was indicated as "S R" before, but it is now indicated as "S S/R R",
where "S/R" is the transition between the two notes. It gives a bit more harmony
and smoothness to the tune, but this is not essential to play. The change can be
more exclusive. This can be easily left out at most of the transition,
especially for a beginner, for whom, this may be too confusing and verbose.

* There is currently no plan to put all these notes into proper rhythm
indication as it is already time-consuming to keep writing notes for Prabhuji's
videos. But if someone is happy to volunteer with adding rhythm notation to the
notes, that would be most welcome. It would surely bring these notes to the next
level.

* Note are sometimes in brackets. This is to indicate that they can be played or
left out optionally as the harmonium player desires.

* There are connected notes, like S/R. This means that both keys are played
simultaneously. This usually happens when transitioning from one note to
another. When learning the basic melody initially, these can be left out. The
melodies may seem a bit overwhelming with these. But these may provide some
taste for advanced players. Doing smooth transitions between notes by holding
both down temporary can increase the taste of the kirtan and bring more energy
overall to the chanting. It is often used when a note is pressed for longer than
the rest in the melody. It is good to have some chord effect then. But it is
just variety that you do not need to put into your kirtan.
